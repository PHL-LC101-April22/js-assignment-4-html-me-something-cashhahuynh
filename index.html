            <h1>Have you seen &quotMaid&quot on Netflix?</h1>
               <p>
                  It follows the story of Alex, a victim of domestic violence, who faces many adversities as she tries to regain control of her life after two years of financial dependency. Alex got to share what a happy day was for her during a group facilitation but she didn't name a moment in the past. Alex shared what a happy day will look like as she and her daughter move toward a brighter future with more certainty than the last episode.

                  I start off with this because the show reminds me of the sacrifices my mom made for me to survive today. As a first generation immigrant, my mom doesn't have the luxury of choice. She did what she needed to do so that my sister and I could have the privilege of choice. Alex's will for survival speaks to me on a deep level because I model my strength and power from my mom's will for survival.

                  I've made many choices in my life that have led me to write this today. A huge choice I made was moving from New Orleans to Maine for college. After college, I made another huge choice and moved to Philadelphia with absolutely nothing lined up. There were many uncertainties to my decision but my mom made it possible to at least take a chance and hope that things will work out. Philadelphia has worked out because of the SeniorLAW Center.

            <h2>Today I am choosing to leave the SeniorLAW Center.</h2>
               <p>
                  SeniorLAW Center has provided opportunities for me to learn and grow and I am grateful for the organization training me to become a better advocate. I invite you all to celebrate my choice because I am ready to graduate from SeniorLAW Center and explore new uncertainties. Thank you.

                  Returning to Alex's happy day prompt: a happy day for me is today, mostly because I haven't made a choice for myself in a while. It’s scary, exciting, and so many other feelings. But it’s different this time because I’m prepared. Send me off to the soft lyrics of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6YXwaQMoFA">“There Will be Another”</a> by Bronze Radio Return.
